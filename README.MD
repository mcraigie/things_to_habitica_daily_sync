# Things -> Habitica Daily Sync Tool

You will need to add your Habitica User ID and API key to the script.
Run this script from a mac workstation with Things.app installed.
It syncs every task completed since the end of the previous day.
Only run it once a day to prevent creating duplicates in Habitica.
Nothing the script does should be destructive to your task data (in either Things or Habitica), but I implore you to read it over and check for yourself.
Use this script at your own risk.
