# Things -> Habitica Daily Sync Script

* This script uses the Things.app AppleScript interface to query your completed tasks
* You will need to add your Habitica User ID and API key to the script
* Run this script from a mac workstation with Things.app installed
* You may want to create a cron job or something similar
* It syncs every task completed since the end of the previous day
* Only run it once a day to prevent creating duplicates in Habitica
* Nothing the script does should be destructive to your task data (in either Things or Habitica), but I implore you to read it over and check for yourself
* Use this script at your own risk
